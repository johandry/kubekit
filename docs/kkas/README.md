# KubeKit As A Service

In KubeKit v2.0, access was only through the CLI. With v2.1, we introduced a server which allows users to interface through a gRPC or REST over HTTP(S) API. We have also included a new client called `kubekitctl` and a GUI called KubeKit Dashboard (`kubekit-dashboard`) to serves a web page or to open a desktop application. There is also a set of libraries or packages in multiple programming languages such as Python, Java and Ruby to facilitate the use of the KubeKit API.

The KubeKit Server centralizes the cluster configuration to allow a team or organization and its users to create, modify or terminate their Kubernetes clusters on the supported platforms.

The purpose of this section is to explain how to use the:

* [KubeKit Server](./server.md)
* [KubeKit Client](./client.md)
* [KubeKit API](./api.md) 
* [KubeKit Dashboard](https://github.com/kubekit/kubekit-dashboard).
